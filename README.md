# Current-EmergingTrends

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

we were given all of the functions to make the pirate agent play the game and learn from the game along with most of the variables necessary to complete the project. The only thing we had to do was create the loop that tied all of the functions together, having the agent choose moves randomly until the functions took over and started choosing moves for it. When the pirate agents win rate was high enough the loop would break and the agent would be considered fully trained and able to win everytime it played.
